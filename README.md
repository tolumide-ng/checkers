## Checkers ðŸ¦…
Simple Checkers engine, that handles all the `checkers` game logic for you, so you don't have to care.
The current implementation uses [MCTS(Monte-Carlo Tree Search)](https://gibberblot.github.io/rl-notes/single-agent/mcts.html), in the future, this program might be extended to allow users provide their desired search heuristic algorithm
